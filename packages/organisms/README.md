Larger Gluon interface structures. The package is optional and depends only
downward on Core, Quarks, Atoms, and Molecules.

```ts
import { AppShell } from '@gluonjs/organisms';
```

`AppShell` emits native `header`, `nav`, `main`, and `footer` landmarks only for
content the caller supplies. When a page has multiple navigation landmarks, the
caller must give the supplied navigation content a distinct accessible name.
Its layout uses logical dimensions and collapses to one column below 48rem.

Install the shared foundation and theme once through `installUi()` from
`@gluonjs/atoms`. `AppShell` carries its exact immutable stylesheet dependency,
and renderer ownership follows its target-local lifecycle. Import-time DOM
mutation remains prohibited. The deprecated `organismStyles` aggregate cannot
coexist silently with exact rendering.
`organismManifest` records the stable contract, compiled interactive example,
browser coverage, and visual-regression evidence.

`AppShell.attributes` extends its outer native div while its landmark children
remain owned by explicit props. App-local Organisms use the public
`defineOrganism()` metadata helper; it adds no lifecycle, registration,
styling, validation, or cleanup behavior. See the complete
[extension contract](../../docs/ui-extensibility.md).

GLUON GOODS defines its real `CheckoutExperience` page layout with
`defineOrganism()`. The composition contains the single delivery form, repeated
FormFields, app-local PurchaseAction, and live order summary; Router, Store,
form state, rendering, and lifecycle ownership remain with the application.
